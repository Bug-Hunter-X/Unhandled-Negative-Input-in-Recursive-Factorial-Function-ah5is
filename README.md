This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: not handling negative input values. The `factorial()` function is recursively defined to compute the factorial of a non-negative integer. However, calling the function with a negative argument causes an infinite recursion resulting in a `RecursionError`. The solution involves adding a check for negative input and raising a `ValueError` to handle such cases gracefully.
